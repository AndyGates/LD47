## Game Blurb

You are a scientist on a research vessel. Something goes terribly wrong. You find your self fleeing the vessel in a badly damaged ship. You don't have enough resources to escape back to your dimension. You need to use resources you can find on planets and astroid you pass to get to the portal back to your world. The research vessel is malfunctioning and every so often it outputs an electro magnetic force that draws you back to it. Your only chance to escape is to discover the fastest route whilst collecting resources and then when your ready, try and get to the portal between the pulses. 

Click on nodes to either navigate to them or apply an action. Hovering over nodes will show you available travel costs to the node as well as its resources if available. You can build refineries on nodes that have the building space, that will generate fuel over time that you can come back and collect.
