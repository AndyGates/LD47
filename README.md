Anomaly
You are a scientist on a research vessel. Something goes terribly wrong. You find yourself fleeing the vessel in a badly damaged ship. You don't have the supplies needed to escape back to your dimension. Use the resources available on planets and asteroids nearby to reach the portal back to your world. 

The research vessel is malfunctioning and every so often it outputs an electromagnetic force that draws you back. Your only chance for escape is to collect resources, discover the fastest route and when you're ready, try to reach the portal between pulses.


How To Play
Click on nodes to either navigate to them or apply an action. 

Hovering over nodes will show available travel costs to the node as well as its resources if available.

You can build refineries on nodes that have the building space, that will generate fuel over time that you can come back and collect.
